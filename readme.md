**Team helloWorld**
=============

Our team is to deal with development of a platform for subsequent simulations of different physical behaviours. 

Irrlicht [Version 1.8]
-----------------------
Irrlicht is the open source 3D Engine written in C++

We will be implementing two Physics Engines - Bullet and Tokamak into Irrlicht.
Physics Engines provides a simulation for the systems, making it more interactive. 


Bullet [Version 2.82]
---------------------
Bullet is an open source physics engine that allows higher quality physics simulation. 
It provides state of the art collision detection, soft body and rigid body dynamics.


Tokamak [Version 1.05a]
------------------------
Tokamak is an open source physics engine that is a high performance real-time physics library.
It features a unique iterative method for solving constraint. 

Configuration
--------------
- Clone the repository into your computer using this url: https://github.com/facemyfate/IrrlichtProject
- Please ensure that Visual Studio is downloaded into your computer
- After cloning, import the project into Visual Studio
- Go to Visual Studio, - Set the appropriate directory path for the libraries.
- Start coding and sync latest files into the folder directory.
